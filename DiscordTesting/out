The first is that it takes approximately 5 minutest per stack, and the second is that it only returns 50% of the concrete (which isn't a big deal, considering we have infinite concrete, but it bumps the output up to 1 stack every 10 minutes). It definitely has some potential, but currently it is inefficient.
